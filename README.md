The project is a competition project in collaboration with an industrial robotics innovation team (3 people). This repository (and PDF) mainly shows the machine intelligence algorithm training and optimization part led by me. Robot control, computer vision image acquisition and optimization, and other related code and results that were the responsibility of others have been removed.

According to the competition agreement, the copyright of this project is jointly owned by the participating team and the organizer, so no specific code will be shown here. Meanwhile, the relevant specific parameters have been blurred and modified, please understand.
