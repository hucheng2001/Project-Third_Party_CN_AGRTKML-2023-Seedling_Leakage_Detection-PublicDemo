# Project-WorkforThirdParty_CN_AGRTKML-2023-Seedling_Leakage_Detection-PublicDemo

## Please see the “[Work Sample] Seedling leakage detection based on YOLOv5.pdf” file.
The details of the project are presented in the PDF document, and the code content can be provided privately if necessary.

## Permissions and Privacy
The project is a competition project in collaboration with an industrial robotics innovation team (3 people). This repository (and PDF) mainly shows the machine intelligence algorithm training and optimization part led by me. Robot control, computer vision image acquisition and optimization, and other related code and results that were the responsibility of others have been removed.

According to the competition agreement, the copyright of this project is jointly owned by the participating team and the organizer, so no specific code will be shown here. Meanwhile, the relevant specific parameters have been blurred and modified, please understand.

## Project Introduction
This project aims to solve the problem of seedling leakage during the transplanting process of agricultural transplanters. In the traditional transplanting process, seedling leakage often leads to no seedlings in some areas, which requires manual replanting, increasing labor costs. We use the YOLOv5 target detection model, machine vision and image processing technology to detect seedling leakage in real time.

## Frameworks and languages
Python and YOLOv5
